# HOME-LAB SETUP AND BASIC SCAN

## Objective

The Home Lab and basic scan project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to set up Kali Linux and Ubuntu virtual machines to have an isolated environment where I could simulate attacks, practice cybersecurity techniques, and conduct cybersecurity projects. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Nmap commands
- Using kali Linux 
- Using ubuntu
- Setting up network connectivity between two devices/ virtual devices

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux - cybersecurity-focused Linux distribution
- Ubuntu - Linux distribution
- Nmap - vulnerability assessment/ analysis
- Vmware fusion - virtual machine tool
